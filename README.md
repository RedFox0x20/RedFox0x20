	<h3>OS Development Projects</h3>
	<p>
		The RedFox32 OS Development repositories is one of the largest projects I have undertaken to date. The project is nowhere near completion and probably won't be for a long time. These projects aim for very in depth learning about modern computer systems and how software for them can be written. During the development of these projects, documentation will be produced to allow future developers to learn from what I did and from what others did. OS Development is a very niche area of the programming world, many sources of documentation are very outdated and as such becoming harder and harder to find online. I aim to bring the knowledge back from the depths of the internet and store it here.

	<h3>Archived Projects</h3>
	<p>
		These projects primarily existed as I learnt new programming methods, paradigms, languages and for a variety of other reasons.
		<br>
		None of these projects are maintained and their GitHub status has been set to Archived.
		<br>
		Some of these repositories state why they were built and at what stage of my learning I was in however, most do not.
